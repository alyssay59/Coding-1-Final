# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for F2020 Coding 1
 My website is based around the idea of art and the different types. On the home page, if the carousel  worked, you would see that there were multiple pictures that dipicted different types of artwork;  painting, digital, and outdoor art. The website wasn't supposed to go into as much detail as I would have liked for the concept of art but it hit a few of the good points. On the About us page, it goes into detail on the idea of digital art work. Even this website itself is a form of art and I tried to make that come across through the website.
